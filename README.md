Solar Farm Analysis in India

Description

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of solar farms in India, focusing on the relationship between solar irradiance, population density, and land usage. It includes data visualizations, geographic mappings, and insights derived from multiple datasets and Python-based notebooks.

Features

Jupyter Notebooks: Step-by-step analysis of solar irradiance, population data, and solar farm statistics.

Data Visualizations: Bar graphs and maps visualizing key metrics such as state-wise solar farm distribution and urban-rural splits.

Geospatial Data: Utilizes shapefiles and geographic data for mapping solar farm locations.

Datasets: Includes curated datasets for population, solar irradiance, and land use.
